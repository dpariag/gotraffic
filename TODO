TODO:
-----
	- Add AF_PACKET device
	- Fix bug where pcap_device is never cleanly shutdown (goroutines, pcap handles)
	- Packet listener goroutines (player, network.Device) should shutdown cleanly.
      This means they should not block indefinitely on a channel waiting for a packet. Select!
	- Select I/O method (AF_PACKET, PCAP,...) automatically based on platform?
	- Look into using ZeroCopyReadPacketData() - requires returning metadata to Players
	- Unit test for network.BridgeGroup
	- Write a RESTFUL stats interface (bytes/packets)
	- Think about how to get richer stats out of MixPlayer
	- Unit test player/ip_rewrite.go 
	- Think about how to start and stop a player. What happens to stats, state, channels?
	- Add a unit test that tests start/stop/start replay. Stats should increase and be correct.
	- Add a unit test that tests MixPlayerStats don't increase after stopping traffic
	- Add a player unit test for concurrent flow replay (two active players)
	- Patch kernel so you can profile on OSX 
	- Write a unit test that checks packets are sent/rcvd in order (e.g by writing a PCAP)
	- FlowGroup should store flow pointers, not values
	- Add more captures to the capture DB
	- Figure out a better API for mix (NextFlowGroup is weak)
	- Design diagram
	- Measure packet latency
	- Make sure channels are directional when possible
	- Review pointer and non-pointer receivers. Clean up as needed.
	
Completed
---------
	- Read packets using a PCAP reader
	- Count dropped packets (optional?)
	- Export duration, and bitrate from a flow
	- Separate interface mgmt into an "L3" layer
	- Implement first cut of flow.mix and flow.mixPlayer according to notes in Gmail
	- Add stats to Network.Interface
	- Write a bridge group interface 
	- Implement a fake bridge group for unit testing
	- Write interface for BridgeGroup stats
	- flow player should send client/server packets to the right 1/2 of the bridge group 
	- Rewind git repo to remove Chris' changes
	- Add byte stats to flow.Player (currently only counts packets)
	- Fix bug where player stats accumulate in the mix player
	- Add mixPlayer stats to enable unit testing
	- Unit test mixPlayer
	- Figure out if layers are separate from underlying packet data. Try serialization code
      that is in the gopacket documentation
	- Implement an IPAddress factory that players can use to obtain unique source IPs
	- Rework stats structs to be re-usable across players and devices
	- Make PCAP interface use stats.Directional
	- Allow more than one copy of a flow to be played from a traffic mix
	- When mixPlayer restarts a flow, it should use a different 5-tuple
	- Reorganize code into directories, make file names consistent 
	- Make sure players are not in the flow package.
	- Fix the registration bug (bridge group registration is not concurrent-safe) 
	- Add the ability to generate a slice if IPs
	- Write a player interface
	- Support starting/stopping flow replay at arbitrary times
	- Fix the bug in IP re-writing, where the source IP is always over-written 
	  (instead of the subscriber IP)
	- Figure out how to end the application after a certain duration and shutdown cleanly 
	- Improve stat names (stats.PlayerStats, stats.BridgeGroupStats, etc.)
	- Make sure flows are passed to players by pointer/reference not value
	- Devices should auto-start (no need for Init())?
	- Add the notion of role to a network.Device (for returning packets)
	- Add BridgeGroup based on any network.Device
	- Import Fiori's code and push stats from the traffic generator to the web UI
	- Add cmd line args and rename client
	- Rename deviceHandle to ioHandle 
	- Unit test network.Device
