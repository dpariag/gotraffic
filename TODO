TODO:
-----
	- Design diagram
	- Rework stats structs to be re-usable across players and devices
	- Add mixPlayer stats to enable unit testing
	- Allow more than one copy of a flow to be played from a traffic mix (registration bug)
	- Figure out a better API for mix (NextFlowGroup is weak)
	- Write a player interface
	- Write a stats interface (bytes/packets)
	- Make file names consistent. Avoid mix of CamelCase and underscores
	- Measure packet latency (command line option?)
	- Read and Write packets using AF_PACKET 
	- Make sure channels are directional when possible
	- Figure out how to end the application after a certain duration and shutdown cleanly 
	- Investigate passing pointers to gopacket.Packets on the BridgeGroup channels
	- Review pointer and non-pointer receivers. Clean up as needed.
	- When mixPlayer restarts a flow, it should use a different 5-tuple
	- Think about how runtime stats will be collected/reported. Do you need:
		- interface/bridge group stats?
		- per flow stats?
		- per protocol stats?
	
Completed
---------
	- Read packets using a PCAP reader
	- Read packets using PF_RING reader
	- Count dropped packets (optional?)
	- Export duration, and bitrate from a flow
	- Separate interface mgmt into an "L3" layer
	- Implement first cut of flow.mix and flow.mixPlayer according to notes in Gmail
	- Add stats to Network.Interface
	- Write a bridge group interface 
	- Implement a fake bridge group for unit testing
	- Write interface for BridgeGroup stats
	- flow player should send client/server packets to the right 1/2 of the bridge group 
	- Rewind git repo to remove Chris' changes
	- Add byte stats to flow.Player (currently only counts packets)
	- Fix bug where player stats accumulate in the mix player
	- Unit test mixPlayer
